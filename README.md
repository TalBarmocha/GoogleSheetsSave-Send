# GoogleSheetsSave&Send
I needed to create a backup for my google sheets and then send the backup to my work mail.
so I created this script to help me do this automatically.


This script downloads a sheet from 'Google Sheets' send it via gmail and then deletes it from the location downloaded


thanks to @The-Intrigued-Engineer for the encoding solution
